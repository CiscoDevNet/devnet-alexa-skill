# DevNet Alexa Data Center Skill Lab

## Setup Your environment
These steps will setup your environment and get you ready to put together your DevNet Alexa Data Center Skill.

#### Get the Skill Code
1. Double-Click the "Coding Alexa Skill" icon on the desktop. This will open a command window in a directory where you'll do your work.

2. Make a directory called "**alexa**"

  - type this command

    `mkdir alexa`

    and hit enter

3. Change to the "**alexa**" directory you just made

  - type this command

    `chdir alexa`

    and hit enter

4. Get the code with Git, this code will be the **Lambda Function**

  - type this command

    `git clone https://github.com/movinalot/devnet-alexa.git`

    and hit enter.

    **It will take a few moments for the code to download**.

  You just **cloned** (copied) code to your computer from **github.com** This is the code that will run in AWS in the Lambda service when your voice request triggers it

#### Make and Activate a Virtual Environment
1. Make a virtual environment where you'll put the Skill code pieces together.

  - type this command

    `virtualenv.exe venv`

    and hit enter

    This command setups a virtual environment and puts it in a directory called "**venv**" directly beneath the directory where you are currently located.

    **It will take a few moments for the command to run**.

2. Copy the files from the "**devnet-alexa**" directory to the "venv" directory

  - type this command

    `copy .\devnet-alexa\* .\venv`

    and hit enter

    You did this to keep a clean copy of the file in the "**devnet-alexa**" directory and have working copies in the "**venv**" directory

3. Change to the "**venv**" directory

  - type this command

    `cd venv`

    and hit enter

4. Activate the virtual environment

  - type this command

    `.\Scripts\activate`

    and hit enter

    Your prompt will now have a "**(venv)**" prefix. This prefix lets you know that you are in a virtual environment.

#### Install the AWS CLI and Configure AWS Credentials
1. Install the "AWS CLI", this is a package of Python code that allows you to interact with the AWS service from you command line

  - type this command

    `pip install awscli`

    and hit enter

    **This operation will take a few moments to complete**.

    There will be a significant amount of output from this command.

  **Install AWS CLI**

2. Configure your AWS Credentials, default AWS region and output format. These setting allow you to interact with the AWS services without having to continually enter your credentials or specify region or output format.

  - type this command

    `aws configure`

    and hit enter

    - enter your AWS Access Key ID - `AKIAISJCICCZVZ4P3GAA`
      <br>The *AWS Access Key ID* shown above is a ***sample***. **Your** *AWS Access Key ID* is shown in the lab information panel.

    - enter your AWS Secret Access Key - `MNmwBfJCmnJN402Fnw+WZCca/YCH8YdwCt6K9caM`
    <br>The *AWS Secret Access Key* shown above is a ***sample***. **Your** *AWS Secret Access Key* is shown in the lab information panel.

    - enter your Default region name - `us-east-1`
      <br>This is the ***actual*** value you need to enter

    - enter your Default output format - `json`
      <br>This is the ***actual*** value you need to enter

#### What You Have Done So Far!
Good job so far! Here's what you've done.

- You **created** a directory for all your work called "**alexa**"

- You **cloned** all the code for the "**Alexa Skill**" into a sub-directory of your "**alexa**" directory, called "**devnet-alexa**".

  The `'git'` command created that directory for you when you cloned the code from 'Github'

- You created a virtual environment called "**venv**" that is a a sub-directory of your "**alexa**" directory, called "**venv**"

- You **copied** the files that you **cloned** with the `'git'` command from the "**devnet-alexa**" to the "**venv**" directory.

- You **changed** directories to the "**venv**" directory.

  This is where you'll do your local work.

- You **activated** the virtual environment

  You should have noticed your prompt changed from

  - `PS C:\Users\demouser\alexa\venv>`

    **to**

  - `(venv) PS C:\Users\demouser\alexa\venv>`

- You **installed** the AWS CLI Python package

- You **configured** your AWS credentials

Now your environment is setup and ready to go.

The next step is to **package** the code and **create** the Lambda Function.
