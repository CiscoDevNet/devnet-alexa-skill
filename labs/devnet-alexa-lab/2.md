# Step 2: Set up your environment

Follow these steps to set up your environment and prepare to put together your DevNet Alexa Data Center Skill.

## Get the Skill code
1. Double-Click the "**Coding Alexa Skill**" icon on the desktop. This action opens a command window in a directory where you do your work.

  **Coding Alexa Skill**<br>

2. Make a directory called "**alexa**".

   Type this command:

   `mkdir alexa`

   and press enter.

3. Change to the "**alexa**" directory you just made.

   Type this command:

   `chdir alexa`

   and press enter.

4. Get the code with a Git command, where this code becomes the **Lambda Function**. Type this command: `git clone https://github.com/movinalot/devnet-alexa.git` and press enter. *Note: It may take a few moments for the code to download*.

  You just **cloned** (copied) code to your computer from **github.com**. This is the code that runs in AWS in the Lambda service when your voice request triggers it.

## Make and activate a virtual environment
1. Make a virtual environment where you'll put the Skill code pieces together.

  Type this command:

    `virtualenv.exe venv`

    and press enter.

    This command sets up a virtual environment and puts it in a directory called "**venv**" directly beneath the directory where you are currently located.

    **It will take a few moments for the command to run**.

2. Copy the files from the "**devnet-alexa**" directory to the "**venv**" directory.

 Type this command:

    `copy .\devnet-alexa\* .\venv`

    and press enter.

    You ran this command to keep a clean copy of the file in the "**devnet-alexa**" directory and have working copies in the "**venv**" directory.

3. Change to the "**venv**" directory.

  Type this command:

    `cd venv`

    and press enter.

4. Activate the virtual environment.

  Type this command:

    `.\Scripts\activate`

    and press enter.

    Your prompt now has a "**(venv)**" prefix. This prefix lets you know that you are in a virtual environment.

## Install the AWS CLI and configure AWS credentials
1. Install the "AWS CLI". This is a package of Python code that you use to interact with the AWS service from your command line.

  Type this command:

    `pip install awscli`

    and press enter.

    **This operation will take a few moments to complete**.

    You see a significant amount of output from this command.

  **Install AWS CLI**

2. Configure your AWS Credentials, default AWS region and output format. These settings allow you to interact with the AWS services without having to continually enter your credentials or specify region or output format.

  Your credentials are located under the **Lab Resources** on the left-hand side of the lab page. If you do not see the Lab Resources click the *3-line* icon in the lab title bar. This icon opens and closes the left-side lab panel.

  The lab panel should have two top-level icons:

      - An open book icon, where each item is a link to a lab page.
      - A flask icon, where you can see additional lab resources.

      **Lab Resources / AWS Credentials**

  To configure your credentials, type this command:

    `aws configure`

    and press enter.

    - At the prompt, enter your AWS Access Key ID from the lab resources panel. This key is an example: `AKIAISJCICCZVZ4P3GAA`
      <br>The *AWS Access Key ID* shown above is a ***sample***. **Your** *AWS Access Key ID* is shown in the lab resources panel.

    - At the prompt, enter your AWS Secret Access Key from the lab resources panel. Here is an example: `MNmwBfJCmnJN402Fnw+WZCca/YCH8YdwCt6K9caM`
    <br>The *AWS Secret Access Key* shown above is a ***sample***. **Your** *AWS Secret Access Key* is shown in the lab resources panel.

    - At the prompt, enter your Default region name: `us-east-1`.
      <br>You want the US East region since it's closest to our event, so this is the ***actual*** value you need to enter.

    - At the prompt, enter your Default output format: `json`.
      <br>You want JSON format, so this is the ***actual*** value you need to enter.

## Recap
Good job so far! Here's what you've done.

- You **created** a directory for all your work called "**alexa**".

- You **cloned** all the code for the "**Alexa Skill**" into a sub-directory of your "**alexa**" directory, called "**devnet-alexa**".

  The `git` command created that directory for you when you cloned the code from GitHub.

- You created a virtual environment called "**venv**" that is a a sub-directory of your "**alexa**" directory, called "**venv**".

- You **copied** the files that you **cloned** with the `'git'` command from the "**devnet-alexa**" to the "**venv**" directory.

- You **changed** directories to the "**venv**" directory.

  This is where you do your local work.

- You **activated** the virtual environment.

  You should have noticed your prompt changed from:

  - `PS C:\Users\demouser\alexa\venv>`

    **to**

  - `(venv) PS C:\Users\demouser\alexa\venv>`

- You **installed** the AWS CLI Python package.

- You **configured** your AWS credentials by entering them at the prompts.

Now your environment is set up and ready to go.

The next step is to **package** the code and **create** the Lambda Function.

Go to page 3, **Create the Lambda Function**.
