#### Test the GetFaults Intent
1. Using your Amazon Echo Dot

    After a few moments the Echo (Alexa) should respond with the status of the request. If successful Alexa will respond with the overall system fault counts found at the top of the UCS Manager Interface.

#### Test the ProvisionServer Intent
1. Using your Amazon Echo Dot

  - ***Speak*** - "Alexa ask devnet to Provision a Server."

    After a few moments the Echo (Alexa) should respond with the status of the request. If successful Alexa will respond with the server blade number and chassis number as well as the Service Profile name that was assigned to the server and the name of the Organization in which the Service Profile resides.

    All Service Profiles will be provisioned in the "DevNet" Organization. To view the activity in action, in the UCS Manager interface

  - ***Click*** the "Servers" icon

  - ***Click*** the "Twisty" next to "root" to expose the "Sub-Organizations" header

    The first time you request the provisioning of a server, the "DevNet" Organization will be created. The first Service Profile will be named "DevNet_Skill_Server_01".

    Each additional request will increment the suffix number to one greater than the highest existing suffix number

#### Test the AddVlan Intent
1. Using your Amazon Echo Dot

  - ***Speak*** - "Alexa ask devnet to Add Vlan 100."

    After a few moments the Echo (Alexa) should respond with the status of the request. If successful Alexa will respond with a message indicating the result of the AddVlan intent.

      All VLANs will be provisioned "Lan Cloud" Global VLANs. To view the activity in action, in the UCS Manager interface

  - ***Click*** the "Network" icon

  - ***Click*** the "Twisty" next to "Lan" to expose the "Lan Cloud" header

  - ***Click*** the "Twisty" next to "Lan Cloud" to expose the "VLANs" header

  - ***Click*** the "Twisty" next to "VLANs" to expose any existing VLANs

    "Alexa ask devnet to Add Vlan 1"

    "Alexa ask devnet to Add Vlan 4048"

    "Alexa ask devnet to Add Vlan 5000"

    If a VLAN already exists then Alexa will respond with that information as well.
