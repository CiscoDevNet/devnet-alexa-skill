# DevNet Alexa Data Center Skill Lab

## Create the Lamdba function
Lamdba functions are serverless funtions that are store in AWS. These functions are **triggered** in some way; a point in time, a log file entry, a database event, etc.

In the case of an Alexa Skill the Lambda function is triggered when the Alexa Skill "hears" one of its utterances. You'll get to setup the utterances on the next page.

## Change and Package The Code

First you need to make a small modification to the Lambda code. Then package the changed code with existing supporting supporting code.

1. Change the code so that it uses your assigned **UCS Manager** You should already be in the **venv** directory

  - type this command `notepad ucsm_operations.py`

  - enter your UCS Manager IP address, where the code looks like this:

    `ucsmhost = "Your UCS Manager IP"`

    change "Your UCS Manager IP" to your assigned UCS Manger IP. For example if your UCS Manager IP address is `10.10.10.10` then the code will look as shown below

    `ucsmhost = "10.10.10.10"`

  - Save the changes and exit out of notepad

2. Package the changed code with `zip`
